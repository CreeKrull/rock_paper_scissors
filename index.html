    // Computer prompts player, "Would you like to play RPS? (y/n)"
    // Player responds y or n.
    // Evaluate y or n response:
    // If no, return message to player, "Maybe another time."; program ends
    // If yes, return message to player, "Great! Best of five rounds wins. Let's get started: type in your choice - rock, paper or scissors - and press enter."
    // Evaluate the response of the player: valid or invalid?
    // If invalid response, return message to player, "Sorry, I didn't understand what you typed. Please try your choice again, and remember to go with rock, paper or scissors." 
    // If valid response, run a function called getComputerChoice to return a randomized value. 
    // Evaluate the valid player choice against the computer's choice.
    // If both the player and the computer make the same choice, return this message: "Darn! A tie! Let's try again - enter your choice." Run the evaluation again.
    // If the player's choice beats the computer's choice, return this message: `You win! ${playerSelection} beats ${computerSelection}!`.
    // Otherwise, return this message: `Oooh, that smarts! ${computerSelection} always beats ${playerSelection}.`.
    // Increment a counter variable, rounds, for the number of rounds played by 1.
    // Increment another counter variable, playerWins, by 1 if the player has won the round.
    // Otherwise, increment a counter variable called computerWins by 1.
    // When rounds = 5, compare playerWins against computerWins.
    // Tell the player who has won the game.
